## Why I Need Your Help
I’ve been invited for a doctoral research stay in the USA. While there, I want to keep improving **SimpleKivy**—but balancing research and open-source work is challenging without funding.

Your support will help me:
- 🔬 Cover living costs during my stay, so I can focus on research and coding.
- 💻 Accelerate SimpleKivy’s development—bug fixes, Linux/MacOS support, and better docs.
- 🎓 Keep the project 100% free.

If you find **SimpleKivy** useful, consider donating to help fund my education and development efforts. Every contribution, no matter how small, makes a difference!
