SimpleKivy was created to solve a problem: Kivy is powerful, but can be complex. Our goal is to make it simple. We provide a streamlined, Python-only way to build modern GUIs, so you can focus on your application's logic, not its layout.

Driven by a passion for intuitive Python tools, SimpleKivy is developed and maintained by a solo developer. This focused effort ensures a cohesive vision: to empower everyone—from beginners to professionals—to create beautiful applications quickly.

The project thrives on community input and grows with every contribution. Whether you code, document, test, or share ideas, you help shape its future.
