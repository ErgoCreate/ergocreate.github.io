**PyESS** is an Equation System Solver based on Python and a UI made with [SimpleKivy](https://ergocreate.github.io/simplekivy). 

Simply write equations and let Python find the best solution.

Supported solvers:
- `fsolve`: Find the roots of your system of equations. Based on `scipy.optimize.fsolve`.
- `minimize`: Find the set of values that minimize the error of your system of equations. Based on `scipy.optimize.minimize`.
- `sympy`: Algebraically solve equations and systems of equations. Based on `sympy.solve`.
